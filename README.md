# Rock-paper-scissors
Hello!
This program is a Rock, paper, scissors game.
In this program, you choose one of the options Rock, paper, scissors, and the program chooses a number from 1 to 3, and each number represents one of the options.
If the option entered by you is the same as the option entered by the computer, no points will be added to either, and if the computer's option was better than the user's option, for example, the computer entered a rock and the user entered scissors, points will be given to the computer, and if it was the other way around, the option given to the user.
After each hand of the game, the scores are shown immediately and if a person's score reaches 5 or the user enters E, the game ends.
